    <h1>Erty's Reddit Time 2019</h1>
    <div id="about">
        <p>In 2019, I decided that I was going to track all of the time I spent on Reddit and Imgur (my two largest time-wasters at the time).</p>
        <p>So, I made a rule: I could go on those sites as much as I wanted, but I had to "check in" by adding a row to a spreadsheet before I started, and "check out" on that row when I was done.</p>
        <p>This was not only an exercise in data collection, but also mindfulness. With my first child born this year, I knew I wanted to spend less time aimlessly scrolling and more time with my family, but I wasn't sure how to break free of the desire to pull my phone out and look at memes every time I was bored for more than a second.</p>
        <p>Through this project, I forced myself to become aware of the time I was wasting, and have happily stopped browsing those sites (except on occasion with friends) in 2020. I think this has contributed a lot to my wellbeing.</p>

    <div id="stats">
        <p>In 2019, I spent 17,727 minutes browsing memes, or 12.3 days. That's 3.34% of the year.</p>
        <p>Below, the black lines represent this time.</p>
